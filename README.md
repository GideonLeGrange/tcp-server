tcp-server
==========
This is a simple library to easily add a TCP service to a Java application. 

The library makes it even easier to provide your application with a 'Telnet' interface by defining a simple interface to
implement and a server class that manages the TCP sessions and connections. It also provides IP ACL support for rudementary security.
